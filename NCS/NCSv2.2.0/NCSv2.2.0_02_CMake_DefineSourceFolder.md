# CMake:  defining a folder where all *.c files will automated be added to your project

## Introduction

In previous chapter we have seen how to add *.c files to your project. But instead of adding each single c file manually, we can also define a folder and all c files we copy into this folder will automatically be added to our project.
This chapter describes how to do this. 

## 

1) make a copy of one of the previous projects. 
2) Add in the copied project folder the file src/function.c. 
3) Open Visual Studio Code and add this project to your APPLICATIONS. (Reminder:  Welcome / "Add an existing application")
4) Check which C files were added to the project. (take a look into the project / Source files / Application / src folder)
5) Now replace in the CMakeLists.txt file the __target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)__ instruction by the following one:

       FILE(GLOB app_sources src/*.c)
          target_sources(app PRIVATE ${app_sources})

   When you have done this, your CMakeLists.txt file should look like this:

    _c:/MyWorkspace/hello_world/CMakeLists.txt_
    
       # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

       cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)

       # Find external Zephyr project, and load its settings:
       find_package(Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})

       # Set project name:
       project (MyApp)

       # add sources
       FILE(GLOB app_sources src/*.c)
          target_sources(app PRIVATE ${app_sources})
    
3) After changing the CMakeLists.txt file do a "build". Can you see the "function.c" file in your Application folder now?
4) Click on "Pristine build" and check again the src file list.
