# Reset Views and Panels

Visual Studio Code allows you to move panels or even parts of a panel to another position using drag and drop. If this happens unintentionally, it is often difficult to find that part of the panel again. However, you can reset them to their default locations.
Here is the description for this:

1) Open the Panel Command.
   There are different ways to do this:
   - in the menu "View" click on "Command Pallete..."
   - or use the hot key Ctrl+Shift+P

2) Enter ">View: Reset View Locations"
3) You should now see all panels in their default location.
